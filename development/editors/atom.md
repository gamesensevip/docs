# GameSense API Snippets
*Credits to Nexxed*

1. Open Atom and go to "File" -> "Snippets..." to open the snippets.cson file.
2. [Download](https://gamesense.pub/forums/viewtopic.php?id=12394) and/or paste the contents of the Atom snippets into the snippets.cson file.
3. Save the file and restart Atom for the changes to take effect.

Note: This requires you to install the [language-lua](https://atom.io/packages/language-lua) package for the editor.

These snippets have descriptions (VSCode & Atom only) for most API functions as well as arguments and are currently up-to-date with the current API.
