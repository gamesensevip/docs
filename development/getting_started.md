# Getting started

Lua scripts let you extend the cheat in various ways and are a great way to automate parts of the cheat or just add that one useless feature you always wanted to have. All you need to get started is a text editor and a basic knowledge of the [Lua language](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/). If you made a lua script and would like to release it for other people to use, you can do that in the [CS:GO Lua scripts](https://gamesense.pub/forums/viewforum.php?id=8) subforum.

Lua scripts are stored in your CS:GO Folder and loaded using the Lua container in the MISC tab. If you're having trouble installing a script, refer to [Using lua scripts](docs/using-the-cheat/using_lua_scripts#common-problems)
